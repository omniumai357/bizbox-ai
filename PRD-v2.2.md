# BizBox.ai Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2.2
**Version**: 2.2 Enterprise  
**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Prepared For**: Brotherhood Quantum Development Team, Stakeholders  

## 1. Executive Summary
**Vision**: BizBox.ai is an AI-powered marketing automation platform that streamlines business automation, ad creation, and knowledge management for SMBs, agencies, and enterprises. Leveraging Kimi Cloud Agent Delegate Service, Kimi-Dev-72B cloud execution, anomaly detection, and predictive optimization, it targets $2.6M ARR by Q4 2025 and a $15M auction value by 2026.  
**Market Opportunity**: $25.1B marketing automation market by 2030 (SMBs: $2.3B, agencies: $1.8B, enterprises: $4.2B).  
**Core Value Propositions**:
- 40% higher ad conversions via AI-driven campaigns.
- Mobile-first, WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant holographic UI (#0A0F2B, #39FF14).
- Brother Agent System (97.2% RAI coherence) for task automation.
- AI Server Upgrade ($99/month) for model deployment and streaming.
- Context Oracle for adaptive UI.
- 80% reduction in human-in-the-loop (HITL) workload via Brotherhood Quantum Hub (BQH).

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Integrate AI Server Upgrade ($99/month) into BizBox.ai, enhancing virtual server (Docker), dashboard (React), sandbox (Node.js), and System Assessment Tool.
- Deploy Kimi-Dev-72B on AWS (p4d.24xlarge) and Lambda Labs, with Open WebUI on Mac.
- Automate multi-agent coordination via Kimi Cloud Agent Delegate Service.
- Achieve 100ms API latency, 1.1s page loads, 99.9% uptime, 97.2% RAI coherence.
- Launch public beta (July 2025, 100 users) and migrate AdTopia.io to Replit.
- Secure $15M auction value with $1M/year licensing.

## 3. Features
### 3.1 AI Server Upgrade ($99/month)
- **Virtual Server**: Docker-based, supports Kimi-Dev-72B streaming (run-kimi-cloud.sh).
- **Dashboard**: React-based (KimiClient.jsx), monitors server, Kimi tasks, and metrics.
- **Sandbox**: Node.js, executes user code securely with zero leaks.
- **System Assessment Tool**: Checks Mac compatibility (check-mac-capability.sh).

### 3.2 Kimi Cloud Agent Delegate Service
- Multi-agent coordination (agent_delegate.py, FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL).
- Routes tasks to Brother Agents (Manus, Qwen, Scout) with load balancing and failover.
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring for latency and throughput.

### 3.3 Kimi-Dev-72B Workaround
- Cloud execution on AWS p4d.24xlarge for 2015 MacBook Pro (16GB RAM, 2GB VRAM).
- Local client interface (KimiClient.jsx, run-kimi-cloud.sh, quantize-kimi.sh).

### 3.4 Cloud Anomaly Detection & Optimization
- Real-time VRAM/CPU metrics (QuantumCloudAnomalies.tsx).
- Automated model tuning (ModelOptimizerService.ts).
- Predictive benchmarking (kimi-performance-benchmark.js).

### 3.5 Virus Scanning & Model Management
- ClamAV Lambda (virus_scan.py) for .safetensors files.
- Model API (/api/models, /api/models/upload-url) with Keycloak auth.

### 3.6 Memory System
- Short-term: Replit PostgreSQL (chat_history table).
- Long-term: Mem0 with ChromaDB for persistent storage.
- Entity/Procedural: Tracks users, agents, and workflows.

## 4. User Stories
- As an SMB owner, I want automated ad campaigns to increase conversions by 40%.
- As an agency, I want a secure model API to deploy custom AI models.
- As a developer, I want agent automation to set up Git and deploy services without coding.
- As a stakeholder, I want a scalable platform to achieve $2.6M ARR.

## 5. Success Metrics
- 100ms API latency, 1.1s page loads, 99.9% uptime.
- 97.2% RAI coherence, 60.4% bug resolve rate.
- 90% user retention, $1,000 LTV for BizBox subscriptions.
- 100 beta users by July 2025, $2.6M ARR by Q4 2025.

## 6. Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js 20.18.1, Express.js, Drizzle ORM, Replit PostgreSQL (BizBox/AdTopia), Supabase (QuantaSphere Ω).
- **AI**: LLaVA-13B (Mac), Kimi-Dev-72B (AWS/Lambda Labs), Qwen3-32B (OpenRouter), Grok API (post-integration).
- **Infrastructure**: Replit (Docker, Kubernetes), RunPod ($100/month), AWS ($200/month), Lambda Labs ($300/month), Redis ($50/month).
- **Security**: JWT, GDPR, ClamAV, AES-256 encryption, Cloudflare ($50/month).
- **Integrations**: Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio, Google Analytics, Zapier.

## 7. Constraints
- Mac: 2015 MacBook Pro, 16GB RAM, 2GB VRAM, 50GB storage (cloud workaround for Kimi-Dev-72B).
- Replit: $30/month Pro, PostgreSQL (21 tables, <100ms queries), no Supabase for BizBox.
- Budget: $1,000/month ($960 allocated, $100 contingency).

## 8. Out of Scope
- Automated deployment beyond Replit/AWS.
- Non-marketing automation features (e.g., HR tools).

## 9. Timeline
- **June 21, 2025**: Git repo setup, Open WebUI, Supabase for QuantaSphere Ω.
- **June 25, 2025**: Deploy Agent Delegate Service, Kimi-Dev-72B, update PRD v2.2.
- **June 30, 2025**: Validate 100ms API, 99.9% uptime, push PRD to GitHub.
